**[Bite-Sized A11Y](https://bite-sized-a11y.com/) is a small project where you can find short and solid accessibility posts.**

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d52a18b2-70bc-40c5-a911-816f24d144c7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/eclectic-peony-73f413/deploys)

## The Goal of the Project

The goal is to collect and give you (and us) concise posts about accessibility. It is also a personal notebook where I can learn and repeat what I know about a11y.

## The Rules

- Maximum length of 149 words.
- Title doesn’t count.
- Alt text doesn’t count.
- Code doesn’t count.

## About the Content-Length

Writing about something in just a maximum of 149 words is a double-edged sword. It makes it easier (less content) but more complicated to include everything you want. Learning about accessibility is challenging; we thought creating a note-like post collection would be a good idea.
